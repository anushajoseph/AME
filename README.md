 # WebApp for Women 
<p align="center">
 <img width="300px" src="src/Logo.png"/>
</p>
<p>An Integrated Self-Tracking System for women : Journaling, Period Tracking, Fitness guide, Task Management and other features. Most people spend days upon days talking about empowering women and making their lives easier. Let alone maintain proper hygiene, most people I've met aren't even fully aware of their own options. In a society full of superstitious beliefs clogging people's minds and leading them to mistreat the women in their family, there MUST be some glimmer of education!
I believe it's the small things that count. Therefore, I decided to develop Medusa - a free and open sourced project with the intention of giving girls the knowledge they lack about their own health, charting out the hormonal cycles of people, and letting them keep an eye on their physical and mental well-being.
Can I help?
Absolutely anyone can pitch in!
